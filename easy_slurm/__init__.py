# Easy Slurm

Helps users submit robust jobs to slurm using a python/bash interface.

 - Freezes source code and assets by copying to separate `JOB_DIR`.
 - Copies data to local filesystem of compute node (`SLURM_TMPDIR`)
   for performance.
 - Exposes hooks for custom bash code: `setup`, `setup_resume`,
   `on_run`, `on_run_resume`, and `teardown`.
 - Interrupts running worker process before job time runs out.
 - Auto-saves results back to `JOB_DIR`.
 - On resuming an incomplete run, extracts intermediate saved results
   and runs `*_resume` hooks.

## Details

### status

`status` represents a state machine.

On a given run, it goes through the steps:

```
new/incomplete
initializing
running
[interrupting]
finalizing
completed/incomplete
```

If the current run successfully completes, `status` ends with
`completed`. Otherwise, if it is interrupted, `status` includes
`interrupting` and ends with `incomplete`.
